<p>This is part of my course project for undergraduate course <em>Computational condensed matter physics</em>.</p>

<p>In short, Monte Carlo methods is one reflection of <strong>the Law of Large Numbers</strong>, which indicates that <strong>a large number of randomness could present deterministic behaviour in principle</strong>. For example, from kinetic theory of gases, we  know that a gas is a great amount of particles, whose motions are in nature stochastic, due to colisions with each other and with the walls of container. However, a gas may have stable macroscopic properties, such as pressure, temperature.</p>

<p>Monte Carlo methods are widely used in all computation-related scientific areas. Two common usages are simulation and integration.</p>

<p>The above figure visulizes a classical application of Monte Carlo method to computing <script type="math/tex">\pi</script>.</p>

<p>Denote the indicator random variable of the sector in the figure by <script type="math/tex">X</script> and its expectation <script type="math/tex">\mu = \frac{\pi}{4}</script>. We perform independent experiments <script type="math/tex">n</script> times. <script type="math/tex">\pi</script> can be approximated as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}\pi  &=  4 \times \mathbb{E}(X)\\ &= \frac{4}{n} \times \mathbb{E}(X_1 + \cdots X_n) \\&\approx 4 \times \frac{\#\{ \mbox{points inside circle}\}}{\#\{ \mbox{points inside circle}\} + \#\{ \mbox{points outside circle}\}} \end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Then the standard deviation of the approximation error can be bounded above by <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{error} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{n}} \times \sigma_X = \frac{4}{n} \sqrt{p(1-p)} \le\frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}</script> , as illustrated by the boundary of two swept areas in the above figure.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Monte Carlo method is free from <strong>the Curse of Dimensionality</strong>, from error estimate, we know that the rate of convergence (in probablistic sense) of Monte Carlo method is quite slow, in the order of <script type="math/tex">O(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})</script>, which migth be too slow in many practial applications.</p>
